\section{Problem Statement}

The main problem of stylizing a 3D object in an animation is the \textit{temporal coherence}. The effect given by the stylization has to be kept if the object is moving, rotating and scaling. Many research have been done to solve this problem of \textit{temporal coherence} [reference to Implicit Brushes, Dynamic solid textures, Motion-coherent stylization, ...]. This problem is three sections:

\subsection{Flatness}

The impression of drawing on a flat surface gives the \textit{flatness}. The stylization has a good \textit{flatness} is the image rendered has a good 2D appearence. In order to keep this effect the size and the distribution of the marks of your stylization has to be independant to the distance between the stylized object and the camera.
