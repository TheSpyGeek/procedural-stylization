	abstract = {Non-photorealistic rendering (NPR) algorithms allow the creation of images in a variety of styles, ranging from line drawing and pen-and-ink to oil painting and watercolor. These algorithms provide greater ﬂexibility, control and automation over traditional drawing and painting. Despite signiﬁcant progress over the past 15 years, the application of NPR to the generation of stylized animations remains an active area of research. The main challenge of computer generated stylized animations is to reproduce the look of traditional drawings and paintings while minimizing distracting ﬂickering and sliding artifacts present in hand-drawn animations. These goals are inherently conﬂicting and any attempt to address the temporal coherence of stylized animations is a trade-off. This state-of-the-art report is motivated by the growing number of methods proposed in recent years and the need for a comprehensive analysis of the trade-offs they propose. We formalize the problem of temporal coherence in terms of goals and compare existing methods accordingly. We propose an analysis for both line and region stylization methods and discuss initial steps toward their perceptual evaluation. The goal of our report is to help uninformed readers to choose the method that best suits their needs, as well as motivate further research to address the limitations of existing methods.},

	abstract = {We present a technique to generalize the 2D painting metaphor to 3D that allows the artist to treat the full 3D space as a canvas. Strokes painted in the 2D viewport window must be embedded in 3D space in a way that gives creative freedom to the artist while maintaining an acceptable level of controllability. We address this challenge by proposing a canvas concept deﬁned implicitly by a 3D scalar ﬁeld. The artist shapes the implicit canvas by creating approximate 3D proxy geometry. An optimization procedure is then used to embed painted strokes in space by satisfying different objective criteria deﬁned on the scalar ﬁeld. This functionality allows us to implement tools for painting along level set surfaces or across different level sets. Our method gives the power of ﬁne-tuning the implicit canvas to the artist using a uniﬁed painting/sculpting metaphor. A sculpting tool can be used to paint into the implicit canvas. Rather than adding color, this tool creates a local change in the scalar ﬁeld that results in outward or inward protrusions along the ﬁeld’s gradient direction. We address a visibility ambiguity inherent in 3D stroke rendering with a depth offsetting method that is well suited for hardware acceleration. We demonstrate results with a number of 3D paintings that exhibit effects difﬁcult to realize with existing systems.},

Our work focuses on enabling stylization pipelines with a wide range of control, thereby covering the interaction spectrum with real-time feedback. In addition, we introduce control semantics that allow cross-stylistic art-direction, which is demonstrated through our implemented watercolor, oil and charcoal stylizations. Our generalized control semantics and their style-speci c mappings are designed to be extrapolated to other styles, by adhering to the same control scheme. We then share our implementation details by breaking down our framework and elaborating on its inner workings. Finally, we evaluate the usefulness of each level of control through a user study involving 20 experienced artists and engineers in the industry, who have collectively spent over 245 hours using our system. MNPR is implemented in Autodesk®Maya®and open-sourced through this publication, to facilitate adoption by artists and further development by the expressive research and development community.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a method for creating coherently animated line drawings that include strong abstraction and stylization effects. These effects are achieved with active strokes: 2D contours that approximate and track the lines of an animated 3D scene. Active strokes perform two functions: they connect and smooth unorganized line samples, and they carry coherent parameterization to support stylized rendering. Line samples are approximated and tracked using active contours (“snakes”) that automatically update their arrangment and topology to match the animation. Parameterization is maintained by brush paths that follow the snakes but are independent, permitting substantial shape abstraction without compromising ﬁdelity in tracking. This approach renders complex models in a wide range of styles at interactive rates, making it suitable for applications like games and interactive illustrations.},

Components in OPENNPAR are modularized and consequently reintegrated for various rendering purposes, allowing many kinds of NPR algorithms to be reproduced, including the integration of 2D and 3D methods. Additionally, the system provides support for a range of users (developers, programmers, designers) according to their respective levels of abstraction, thus being available in multiple contexts. Ultimately, OPENNPAR holds great potential as a tool in the development, augmentation, and creation of NPR effects.},

An Implicit Brush is deﬁned at a given pixel by the convolution of a brush footprint along a feature skeleton; the skeleton itself is obtained by locating surface features in the pixel neighborhood. Features are identiﬁed via image-space ﬁtting techniques that not only extract their location, but also their proﬁle, which permits to distinguish between sharp and smooth features. Proﬁle parameters are then mapped to stylistic parameters such as brush orientation, size or opacity to give rise to a wide range of line-based styles.},

	abstract = {Stylized rendering methods, which aim at depicting 3D scenes with 2D marks such as pigments or strokes, are often faced with temporal coherence issues when applied to dynamic scenes. These issues arise from the difﬁculty of having to satisfy two contrary goals: ensuring that the style marks follow 3D motions while preserving their 2D appearance. In this paper we describe a new texture based method for real-time temporally coherent stylization called dynamic textures. A dynamic texture is a standard texture mapped on the object and enriched with an inﬁnite zoom mechanism. This simple and fast mechanism maintains quasi-constant size and density of texture elements in screen space for any distance from the camera. We show that these dynamic textures can be used in many stylization techniques, enforcing the 2D appearance of the style marks while preserving the accurate 3D motion of the depicted objects.},
