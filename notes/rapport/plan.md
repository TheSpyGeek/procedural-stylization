# Introduction

## Context/Backgroung
* Artists want to stylized 3D scenes
* Having a 2D aspect
* good rendering in animation as video games

## Problem statement (Temporal Coherence)
* motion coherence
* temporal continuity
* flatness

## Scientific Approach and Investigative Method and Results


## Content of this report

* Stylize 3D Models
* ensure temporal coherence
* widest variety of style

# State of the art

## Image space

* Applying stroke
* [Image and Video-Based Artistic Stylisation, 2013] apply stroke but suffer of temporal continuity and it can only stylize with paint brush strokes
* [vergne_implicit_2011] use convolution of points to have hand drawing effects.



## Object space

* applying stuff at the surface of the object
* OverCoat => splatting 2D image of the surface of the object, **manually placed**


#### Texture mapping

#### Stroke based
